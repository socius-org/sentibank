# Contribution Criteria
We welcome new lexicons that help expand the coverage and capabilities of sentibank. 

Contributions should meet the following criteria:

## Scope 🎯
- Lexicon is *within the domain of sentiment analysis and opinion mining*. Other linguistic resources may be out of scope.
- Lexicon covers a new domain or expands existing coverage meaningfully. Niche/duplicate datasets are lower priority.

## Composition 📝
- Contains a minimum of 100 labeled sentiment terms/phrases. Smaller sample sizes tend not over-index specific sources.
- Spans common vocabulary in the domain, including slang, acronyms, morphological variations, and domain-specific terminology.
- Provides discrete categorical labels or fine-grained numerical sentiment scores for each entry. Rating scale details should be specified.

## Methodology 🔬
- *Details should be provided* if used a systematic process for collecting representative text sources and annotations.
  - Used a rigorous process for collecting a corpus of texts representative of the target domain. This may involve sampling social media, academic texts, dialog transcripts, etc.
  - Details on source material should be provided.
- *Qualifications should be highlighted* if annotated by subject matter experts, native speakers, trained linguists, or independent qualified annotators.
  - Clear annotation guidelines and rating scales were provided to annotators.
  - Examples of instructions and training procedures should be shared. 
- *Disagreements should be noted and reconciled* if inter-annotator agreement was measured during creation.
  - Ideal to include metrics like Cohen's Kappa 

## Licensing ⚖️
- Lexicon is under a permissive open license compatible with CC-BY-SA 4.0 or public domain.
- Sources allow free re-use, re-distribution, and commercial use. Proprietary datasets cannot be accepted.

## Format 🗂️
- Submitted as a CSV file with column headers specifying key attributes of each entry.
- Uses consistent text encoding (ideally UTF-8) and escapes special characters or markup.
- Contains no personally identifiable or otherwise confidential information.


Please open an [issue](https://github.com/socius-org/sentibank/issues) outlining your proposed lexicon before dedicating resources to annotation. This can serve as a transparent public record on how lexicons are created, processed and enhanced. We expect this record to: Allow all sentibank users to better understand the composition and quality of included dictionaries; Enable substantive community discussion; and Provide a learning opportunity for those developing lexicons in the future.  


>  We understand sentiment annotation can be new territory for many. Please don't hesitate to reach out - we're happy to provide guidance each step of the way.
> 
> Our team has experience developing guidelines, training annotators, measuring agreement, and related tasks. We can lend our knowledge to ensure your project goes smoothly.
> 
> If any part of the process seem unclear, let us know. We're glad to advise on effective instructions, corpus creation, quality control, and any other annotation needs.
> 
> Feel free to reach out through xxx@xxx to discuss best practices tailored to your goals. We look forward to hearing your ideas and providing customised support to make them a reality.
> 
> Our hope is for the criteria to inspire creative solutions, not deter participation. We're here to lower barriers and see new lexicons brought to life through thoughtful partnership.


By pooling our talents, we can transform sentibank into an even more powerful tool. Join us in unlocking sentibank's full potential through shared knowledge!
