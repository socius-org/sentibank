The development of the General Inquirer has been supported by grants from American, British and Australian government science foundations and by industry. 
Those who developed and contributed categories have done so with the understanding that they could be used by others for academic research. 
Many categories have a long and complicated history and may be copyrighted at one point or another. 
Persons who would like to use any category for any commercial use should first send an email to inquirer@wjh.harvard.edu describing its intended use and arrange a permission for that application.
