This section provides guidelines for contributing new lexicons, requesting modifications, and contributing to the codebase.

## Sharing New Lexicons

Creating high-quality sentiment lexicons requires careful consideration of the scope, data sources, annotation process, and format. We welcome new lexicons that meet our [contribution criteria](https://github.com/socius-org/sentibank/blob/main/doc/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

> ðŸ’¡We are currently collaborating with domain experts to create a new *gold-standard* sentiment dictionaries on various social science topics, including `ideology`, `current_affairs`, `market`, `cryptocurrency`, `politics`, `activism_reform`, `academic`, `esg`, and `society`.  If you are a researcher willing to lend your expertise in our progress, please reach out to research@socius.org.  

## Requesting Additions and Modifications

sentibank focuses on including high-quality lexicons from reputable sources. Requests for additions/changes should:

- Identify meaningful gaps not covered by current lexicons
- Provide details if incorrect annotations are suspected  
- Limit to openly licensed or permissioned sources
- Avoid recommending proprietary, nonpublic lexicons

Lexicon requests can be submitted via our [issue](https://github.com/socius-org/sentibank/issues) on Github.
