    "**Evaluation:** Nielsen (2011) compared AFINN against four other sentiment dictionaries on a dataset of 1,000 tweets from the [Pulse of a Nation](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amislove/twittermood/) study, where each tweet was manually labelled for sentiment strength by 10 independent raters.\n",

    "The AFINN (Nielsen, 2011) sentiment lexicon was created to capture both common emotional words and informal internet slang. It provides manually annotated sentiment labels ranging from -5 to +5 for each entry. Though Harvard General Inquirer and OpinionFinder have larger word lists, the author notes AFINN's granular sentiment scoring appears superior to simple binary polarity. This highlights the value of manual valence annotations even for informal terms."
