    "**Composition:**\n",
    "- Approximately 3.8k unigram lexicon entries\n",
    "- Financial domain-specific business phrases and jargon\n",
    "- Multi-Class Multi-Label (`Negative`, `Positive`, `Uncertainty`, `Litigious`, `Strong_Modal`, `Weak_Modal`, and `Constraining`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creation Methodology:**\n",
    "- Lexicon candidates were based on tokens that appeared at least 5% of sampled 10-K filings\n",
    "- The tokens were then manually labelled by the authors \n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation:** Loughran and McDonald (2011) tested the significance of the MASTER dictionary by examining the market’s reaction at the time of a 10-K filing - ‘*If tone matters, firms filing 10-Ks with a high measure of negative words should, on average, experience negative excess returns around the filing date*’ (p.18). Compared to the Harvard_GI’s TagNeg Dictionary (H4N) which showed no significant association to the file date excess returns (t = -1.35, below 95% confidence), MASTER’s ‘Negative’ dictionary showed a statistically significant negative correlation (t = -2.64, above 99% confidence). \n",
    "\n",
    "Bodnaruk, Loughran and McDonald (2015) investigated how well ‘*different measures are able to predict future developments associated with the deterioration or improvement of external financing conditions*’ (p.16). Compared to other ‘traditional measures of financial constraints’, MASTER’s ‘Constraining’ dictionary was the only measure that predicted all four directions of ex-post liquidity events with 1% significance level (p.17, 40). \n",

    "While a sentiment dictionary designed to be applied in the general domain may be useful, ‘English words have many meanings, and a word categorisation scheme derived for one discipline might not translate effectively into a discipline with its own dialect’ (Loughran and McDonald, 2011, p.1). Such generality could potentially lead to Type-I errors due to sentiment misclassification in a different context. For example, Loughran and McDonald (2011) revealed that nearly 73.8% of the negative word counts in Harvard Psychosociological TagNeg Dictionary (H4N) are actually words that are not typically negative in a financial context. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address such constraints, Loughran and McDonald (2011) created a finance-specific dictionary called [MASTER](https://sraf.nd.edu/loughranmcdonald-master-dictionary/). The dictionary is regularly updated by the authors, and was last updated in 2022."

Note that both `Litigious` and `Constraining` lexicons capture a similar “tone”: According to Bodnaruk, Loughran and McDonald (2015), there was a positive correlation between the frequency of `Constraining` lexicons and the frequency of `Litigious` lexicons in the 10-K samples.

There were 2,337 `Negative` lexicons (i.e ‘felony’, ‘litigation’, ‘restated’, ‘misstatement’, ‘unanticipated’), while there were 353 `Positive` lexicons (i.e ‘achieve’, ‘attain’, ‘efficient’, ‘improve’, ‘profitable’), which were substantially fewer. The top 5 most frequently occurring `Negative` lexicons in the 10-Ks sample were ‘loss’, ‘losses’, ‘impairment’, ‘against’ and ‘adverse’. \n",

    "There were 285 lexicons categorised as `Uncertainty` (i.e. 'approximate', 'contingency', 'depend', 'fluctuate', 'indefinite', 'uncertain', and 'variability'), emphasising the general notion of imprecision rather than exclusively focusing on risk. Additionally, there were 731 lexicons categorised as `Litigious` (i.e. 'claimant', 'deposition', 'interlocutory', 'testimony', and 'tort'), reflecting a propensity for legal contest. The inclusion of words like 'legislation' and 'regulation' was made, which do not necessarily imply a legal contest but may indicate a more litigious environment. It's important to note that many lexicons overlapped between the `Negative`, `Uncertainty`, and `Litigious` categories.\n",

    "\n",
    "<sup>[2]</sup> The 2of12inf dictionary originated from the [12dicts project](http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts-readme/), which explored different methods to extract core vocabulary lists from the 12 source dictionaries. From the name 2of12inf, the ‘2of12’ represents the core vocabulary list containing over 40,000 words that appeared in at least 2 of the 12 source dictionaries. This excluded capitalised words, phrases, abbreviations, affixes, and non-American/secondary spellings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ‘inf’ represents the added inflections of those words, expanding the total size to around 81,000 words. However, 2of12inf diverged from only using the 12 source dictionaries. The starting point was a subset of the [AGID list](http://wordlist.aspell.net/agid-readme/) by Kevin Atkinson, incorporating public domain sources like [Moby Words](https://web.archive.org/web/20170930060409/http://icon.shef.ac.uk/Moby/) and [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/). The list does not exclude secondary spellings, non-American usages\n",
