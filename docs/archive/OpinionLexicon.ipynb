    "**Composition:** \n",
    "- Approximately 6.7k lexicons (incl. 221 n-grams)\n",
    "- Includes misspelt spellings that frequently appear in informal settings (product reviews) \n",
    "- Binary Class (`positive`, `negative`) \n",
    "\n",
    "**Creation Methodology:**  \n",
    "- Manually tagged an initial seed list of positive and negative adjectives. \n",
    "- Then leveraged the WordNet to expand this list via an iterative, bootstrapping process. \n",
    "- By repeatedly searching for synonyms and antonyms of 30 seed words in WordNet, the authors were able to determine the semantic orientations for a large number of opinion words\n",

    "**Evaluation:** Hu and Liu (2004) evaluated their sentiment dictionary on customer reviews of 5 electronics products ‚Äî 2 digital cameras, 1 DVD player, 1 MP3 player, and 1 cellular phone‚Äîfrom Amazon and Cnet, by manually labelling each review sentence as positive or negative. Sentences were predicted as positive or negative using a ‚Äúbag-of-words‚Äù approach: if positive/negative lexicon words existed, the review was positive/negative. For sentences with multiple opinion words, the average orientation was used. The authors also accounted for negation words (i.e ‚Äúno‚Äù or ‚Äúnot‚Äù), reversing the sentiment orientation when such words appeared within 5 words of an opinion word. The dictionary achieved 84% accuracy in predicting sentiment orientations, demonstrating its effectiveness at determining sentiment. \n",

    "1. **Creation of Seed Adjectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the ‚Äòsemantic orientation‚Äô (or sentiment polarity) of opinion words, Hu and Liu (2004) first manually created a small list of 30 seed adjectives and tagged them as having either a positive or negative orientation. For example, \"great\" and \"fantastic\" were tagged as positive adjectives, while \"bad\" and \"dull\" were tagged as negative. Based on the seed list, Hu and Liu (2004) then used a bootstrapping technique leveraging WordNet to expand this seed list and determine the orientation of additional adjectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Expansion to Opinion Words (`OrientationSearch`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hu and Liu (2004) leveraged the structure of WordNet, where adjectives are organised into bipolar clusters, to iteratively expand their seed list of opinion words using a function called `OrientationSearch`. The authors assumed that because adjectives generally share the orientation of their synonyms and the opposite orientation of their antonyms, the orientation of a new adjective can be predicted by checking if its synonyms or antonyms appear in the seed list with known orientations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In each `OrientationSearch` call, if the adjective had a synonym in the seed list, it was assigned the same orientation as that synonym. If it had an antonym in the seed list, it was assigned the opposite orientation. The newly oriented adjective was then added to the seed list for subsequent searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "By repeatedly applying `OrientationSearch`, Hu and Liu (2004) were able to leverage the initial seed list of 30 adjectives to expand it significantly. Their final expanded opinion word list contained 2,006 positive and 4,783 negative words by utilising the synonyms and antonyms in WordNet."

    "The original OpinionLexicon dictionary contained three duplicates - \"envious\", \"enviously\", and \"enviousness.\" These words can convey both positive and negative sentiment depending on the context. As the orientation of these ambiguous terms depends on their usage, the duplicate entries were simply removed, resulting in a processed dictionary of 6,786 entries. \n",
