The Archive provides in-depth documentation on all dictionaries currently included in `sentibank`. This enables users to evaluate and select the optimal lexicons for their use case. 

Each lexicon documentation starts with a high-level summary that covers the following key details:
- **Composition**: Number of entries, parts of speech distribution, etc.
- **Methodology**: How the lexicon was generated and annotated
- **Evaluation**: Any validation or quality checks performed
- **Usage Guidance**: Best practices for integrating the lexicon

After the summary, you'll find a comprehensive literature review style documentation diving deeper into the original version's development and any modifications made in the preprocessed version. This provides critical details for fully leveraging the lexicons.

By reviewing both the summaries and detailed documentations, you can thoroughly compare options and determine which resources best fit your needs.
