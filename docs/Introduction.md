# Introduction

## Overview of Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the automated process of identifying and extracting subjective information such as opinions, emotions, and attitudes from textual data. It has become an increasingly critical technique across many social science domains such as business, politics, and economics. 

By unlocking the sentiment embedded in textual data from social media posts, product reviews, and survey responses, organisations can gain invaluable insights into public perceptions, customer preferences, and even voter attitudes. The ability to systematically understand affective states from text has vast potential to inform impactful decisions.
